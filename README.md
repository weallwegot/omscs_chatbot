# omscs_chatbot


The chat bot api is currently in use at [OMSCS Unofficial Reviews](omscentral.com/chat/bot) 

---------------------------

The chat bot is available live [here](youngblksocrates.pythonanywhere.com)

the site above contains instructions for using the chat bot api, an about section, and some more sample questions.

(the source code for the ui is available [here](https://github.com/weAllWeGot/chat-bot-ui-polymer2))

----------------------------------------------------

*Since the chat bot began as a final project for CS 7637 Knowledge Based Artificial Intelligence: Cognitive Systems in Fall 2016, I'm unfortunately not allowed to make the source code public, but i would still love to gather feedback and feature suggestions, so I hope this repository can serve that purpose. Thanks!*
